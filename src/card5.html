              <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>
                This service emphasizes developing applications using serverless architectures on cloud platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions. It involves writing code for event-driven functions that run in response to triggers without managing server infrastructure. Additionally, it includes optimizing applications for cost, performance, and scalability in a serverless environment.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong>Benefits:</strong>
                Reduced operational overhead, cost-effective pricing (pay-as-you-go), auto-scaling, simplified development and deployment, and focus on code rather than infrastructure.</p>
